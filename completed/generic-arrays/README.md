# Creating arrays of generic classes
**Last updated: 2016-02-17**
*When using a class using generics, it is impossible to create an array of them*

## Description
Given a generic class `ExampleClass<T>`, the following array cannot be created:

array := ExampleClass<Type>[count] new()

This fails with the error `No such function new() for ArrayClass`.

To solve this problem, generic classes, even those derived from a generic super class, should be able to be the type of an ooc array, both when `T` is a class and when it is a cover.

## Details
**Reward type:** Medium (400 EUR)
