# Assigning value with covers and properties does not always work
**Last updated: 2016-02-17**
*Properties or operators that return covers must be stored in an intermediary variable*

## Description
Properties or operators that return covers must be stored in an intermediary variable before being assigned to something. An example:

```ooc
// myAttribute in MyCover is calculated using a property

// Not working
result = myCovers[i] myAttribute

// Working
myCover := myCovers[i] // Convert rvalue to lvalue
result = myCover myAttribute
```

The attached test files show some examples using both an `ArrayList` and `Array`.
